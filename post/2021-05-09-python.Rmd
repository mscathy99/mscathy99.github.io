```{R}
```

Square bracks ([]) define a list. Indexing begins at 0, so the first element is at the 0th position. The nth element will be located in the (n-1)th position. 
```{python}
personal_dict = {'firstName':'Cathy', 'lastName':"Nguyen", 'hobbies':['tennis','ice skating', 'singing', 'paper crafting'],'occupation':'student','age':22}
print(personal_dict)
```
